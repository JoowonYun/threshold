# Migrating Legacy Stakes

To be eligible to run a PRE node, there must be a stake on Threshold. This stake can take the following forms:

* Legacy NU stake migrated to T from the [NuCypher Dashboard](https://stake.nucypher.network/manage).
* Legacy KEEP stake migrated to T from the [Keep Dashboard](https://dashboard.keep.network/applications/threshold).
* T stake using liquid T created on the [Threshold Dashboard](https://dashboard.threshold.network/staking).

Once the stake is created, a PRE node can be set up to run on the Threshold Network.

Here is a summary of the overall process:
