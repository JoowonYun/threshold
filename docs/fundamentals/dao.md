# Threshold DAO

Threshold is community-driven and governed by an eponymous DAO that includes the constituencies of both the NuCypher and Keep networks. The community decided that a . The Threshold DAO has three primary bodies: **Tokenholder DAO**, **Staker DAO**, and the **Elected Council**. The goal of this three-pronged approach is to enhance representation while ensuring accountability, as each of these governance bodices will hold the other two accountable, similar to the system of checks and balances found in most constitutional governments. They will also hold separate responsibilities that are embedded in the governance structure. See [this blog post](https://blog.threshold.network/thresholds-governance-structure-and-the-upcoming-council-elections/) and [this proposal](https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-network-dao-proposal-v2/57) for a more extended description of the DAO structure.

From an implementation perspective, both the Tokenholder DAO and the Staker DAO are based on Governor Bravo governance model (in particular, using OpenZeppelin Governance). The Tokenholder DAO is on Ethereum Mainnet at `0xd101f2B25bCBF992BdF55dB67c104FE7646F5447`. The Elected Council is implemented as a Gnosis Safe contract, with a 6-of-9 configuration, also deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, at `0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f`. The Staker DAO is postponed until the complete functionality for staking is released.
