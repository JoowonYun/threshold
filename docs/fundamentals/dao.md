# DAO

Threshold is community-driven and governed by a DAO. The DAO is a [three-pronged system](https://blog.threshold.network/thresholds-governance-structure-and-the-upcoming-council-elections/), based on Compoundâ€™s Governor Bravo: the Token Holder DAO, Staker DAO and Elected Council.

Additionally, there are community-led guilds such as the Marketing Guild, the Integrations Guild, and the Treasury Guild. Each guild is managed by an elected committee and holds regular, rotating elections.

Join a guild (via [Discord](https://discord.gg/threshold) - #dao-contribute channel) and work together with other Threshold DAO members based on your interests and expertise!
