# Guilds

Additionally to the DAO governance bodies, there are community-led guilds such as the Marketing Guild, the Integrations Guild, and the Treasury Guild. Each guild is managed by an elected committee and holds regular, rotating elections.

Join a guild (via [Discord](https://discord.gg/threshold) - #dao-contribute channel) and work together with other Threshold DAO members based on your interests and expertise!
